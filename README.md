# 🚀 365 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **365 Days of Code Challenge**! This is my personal commitment to stay consistent, improve my problem-solving skills, and become a better developer by writing code every single day for 365 days.

## 🗓️ What's the Challenge?

The goal is simple:  
Code for at least 1 hour a day for 365 consecutive days and document my progress here.

## ✅ Challenge Status

I've started this journey with full intention and passion. However, due to **health issues, university exams, and other responsibilities**, I’ve not been able to strictly stick to the **365 consecutive days** pledge.

But I am **not quitting**. Instead, I will keep updating this repository with:

- ✅ The days I was able to code
- 📌 The reason when I couldn't code
- 🔁 What I learned, revised, or worked on during breaks

The focus now is on **consistent progress**, not perfection.

## 📒 Log Format

Each day will be logged in a simple format like:


## 🛠️ Topics I'll Cover

- Data Structures and Algorithms
- LeetCode, GFG, Coding Ninjas practice
- Java + C++ development
- Web Development (MERN + Java Full Stack)
- Project Work & Hackathons

## 📌 Motivation

> “Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.” – Robert Collier
